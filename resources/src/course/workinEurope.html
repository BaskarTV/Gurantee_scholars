  <h5>Why Europe ?</h5>
  <p>Working in a European country can bring a huge number of advantages; everything from gaining better skills, working with people from different cultures, networking with a larger group of professionals or aiming to become more employable</p>
</div>
<div class="benifits">
<h4 id="benfit">Benefits In Europe</h4>
<h5>Work/Life Balance</h5>
<p>Working in a fast-paced environment like the EU institutions can be very demanding. However, the EU supports a healthy work/life balance, which motivates people to be the best version of themselves in and outside the workplace.</p>
<p>Joining the EU institutions will allow you to meet the demands of both your career and your personal life, so you will not need to choose one over the other.</p>
<p>Flexible working hours, teleworking arrangements, access to a wide range of personal development courses and a diverse and inclusive working culture, expatriate benefits (e.g. travel and expatriation allowance) and “family-friendly” benefits (e.g. dependent child allowance, European Schools, parental leave) are just some of the extras offered to support staff wellbeing.</p>
<h5>Salary</h5>
<p>Whether you apply for a permanent position or a temporary contract, the EU institutions offer a competitive salary commensurate with your skills, experience, responsibilities and motivation.</p>
<p>Wages vary according to grade and function;</p>
<p>Salaries increase based on merit and seniority as you progress in your career.</p>
<h5>Family Life</h5>
<p>If you have or are planning a family at some point in your future, you will be entitled to extra benefits such as household and child allowance, parental leave, education allowance and a contribution to annual travel expenses for expatriates and their family members.</p>
<p>Working in Brussels or Luxembourg will give you an added advantage: they are both family-friendly cities, have excellent national and international schools as well as childcare facilities. Among them are the European Schools that offer a multilingual and multicultural education to EU staff children.</p>
<h5>Training Opportunities</h5>
<p>Training courses are available on a wide variety of subjects such as EU diplomacy, inclusion and diversity, EU policies, interinstitutional relations, workplace and social solutions, IT and digital development, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Working with the EU institutions means a lifelong opportunity for professional and personal growth.</p>
